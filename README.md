# QuantumCircuitGamified
Made in godot 4.2.2 (stable) 
Proof of concept for the implementation of quantum circuit simulation in a 3D environment. 
Functionality is limited to gates that do not bridge accross multiple wires. 
Known mathematical problems with the Y and Z gate during calculation of the product of quantum wires.
